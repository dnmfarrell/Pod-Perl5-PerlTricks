<p>How can I easily run the same tests on different data without duplicating a lot of code? If I follow my usual pattern, I start off with a couple of tests where I write some code then cut-and-paste that a couple of times. I add a few more tests before I realize I have a mess. If I had the foresight to know that I would make a mess (again), I would have started with a table of data and a little bit of code that went through it.<sup><a href="#0_1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Consider a silly and small example of testing <code>sprintf</code>-like behaviour of M<String::Sprintf>. I can use this module to create my own format specifiers, such as one to commify a number. I stole this mostly from its documentation, although I threw in the <a href="http://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/2015/04/use-v5-20-subroutine-signatures/">v5.20 signatures feature</a> and the <a href="http://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/2010/09/use-the-r-substitution-flag-to-work-on-a-copy/">v5.14 non-destructive</a> <code>/r</code> flag on the substitution operator> because I love those features:</p>

<pre>use v5.20;
use feature qw(signatures);
no warnings qw(experimental::signatures);

use String::Sprintf;

my $f = String::Sprintf->formatter(
  N => sub {
    my($width, $value, $values, $letter) = @_;
    return commify(sprintf "%${width}f", $value);
    }
  );

say "Numbers are: " . 
  $f->sprintf(
    '%10.2N, %10.2N', 
    12345678.901, 87654.321
    );

sub commify ( $n ) {
  $n =~ s/(\.\d+)|(?<=\d)(?=(?:\d\d\d)+\b)/$1 || ','/rge;
  }

Numbers are: 12,345,678.90,   87,654.32</pre>

<p>The mess I might make to test this starts with a single input and output with the M<Test::More> function <code>is</code>:</p>

<pre>use v5.20;
use feature qw(signatures);
no warnings qw(experimental::signatures);

use Test::More;

sub commify ( $n ) {
  $n =~ s/(\.\d+)|(?<=\d)(?=(?:\d\d\d)+\b)/$1 || ','/rge;
  }

my $class = 'String::Sprintf';
use_ok( $class );

my $f = String::Sprintf->formatter(
  N => sub {
    my($width, $value, $values, $letter) = @_;
    return commify(sprintf "%${width}f", $value);
    }
  );

isa_ok( $f, $class );
can_ok( $f, 'sprintf' );

is(  $f->sprintf( '%.2N', '1234.56' ), '1,234.56' );

done_testing();</pre>

<p>I decide to test another value, and I think the easiest thing to do is to duplicate that line with <code>is</code>:</p>

<pre>is(  $f->sprintf( '%.2N', '1234.56' ), '1,234.56' );
is(  $f->sprintf( '%.2N', '1234' ),    '1,234.00' );</pre>

<p>The particular thing to test isn't the point of this article. It's all the stuff around it that I want to highlight. Or, more correctly, I want to de-emphasize all this stuff around it. I had to duplicate the test although most of the structure is the same.</p>

<p>I can convert those tests to a structure to hold the data and another structure for the behaviour:</p>

<pre>my @data = (
  [ qw( 1234.56 1,234.56 ) ],
  [ qw( 1234    1,234.00 ) ],
  );

foreach my $row ( @data ) {
  is(  $f->sprintf( '%.2N', $row->[0] ), $row->[1] );
  }</pre>

<p>I can add many more rows to <code>@data</code> but the meat of the code, that <code>foreach</code> loop, doesn't change.</p>

<p>I can improve this though. So far I only test that one template. I can add that to <code>@data</code> too, and use that to make a label for the test:</p>

<pre>my $ndot2_f = '%.2N';

my @data = (
  [ $ndot2_f, qw( 1234.56 1,234.56 ) ],
  [ $ndot2_f, qw( 1234    1,234.00 ) ],
  );

foreach my $row ( @data ) {
  is(  $f->sprintf( $row->[0], $row->[1] ), $row->[2],
    "$row->[1] with format $row->[0] returns $row->[2]"
     );
  }</pre>

<p>I can add another test with a different format. If I had kept going the way I started, this would look like a new test because the format changed. Now the format is just part of the input:</p>

<pre>my $ndot2_f = '%.2N';

my @data = (
  [ $ndot2_f, qw( 1234.56 1,234.56 ) ],
  [ $ndot2_f, qw( 1234    1,234.00 ) ],
  [ '%.0N'  , qw( 1234.49 1,234    ) ],
  );

foreach my $row ( @data ) {
  is(  $f->sprintf( $row->[0], $row->[1] ), $row->[2],
    "$row->[1] with format $row->[0] returns $row->[2]"
     );
  }</pre>

<p>As I go on things get more complicated. If a test fails, I want some extra information about which one failed. I'll change up how I go through the table. In this case, I'll use the <a href="http://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/2010/05/perl-5-12-lets-you-use-each-on-an-array/">v5.12 feature</a> that allows <code>each</code> on an array so I get back the index and the value:</p>

<pre>while( my( $index, $row ) = each @data ) {
  is(  $f->sprintf( $row->[0], $row->[1] ), $row->[2],
    "$index: $row->[1] with format $row->[0] returns $row->[2]"
     );
  }</pre>

<p>My code for the test behavior changed but I didn't have to mess with the input data at all. The particular code in this case doesn't matter. This table-driven testing separates the inputs and the tests; that's what you should pay attention to.</p>

<p>It can get even better. So far, I've put all the input data in the test file itself, but now that it's separate from the test code, I can grab the input from somewhere else, like a database table:</p>

<table>
<th>ColA</th><th>ColB</th><th>ColC</th>
<tr><td>%.2N</td><td>1234.56</td><td>1,234.56</td></tr>
<tr><td>%.2N</td><td>1234</td><td>1,234.00</td></tr>
<tr><td>%.0N</td><td>1234.49</td><td>1,234</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Or a pipe separated values file:</p>

<pre class="data">%.2N|1234.56|1,234.56
%.2N|1234|1,234.00
%.0N|1234.49|1,234</pre>

<p>I create <code>@data</code> in the test file by reading and parsing the external file <span class="data">tests.t</span>:</p>

<pre><code>open my $test_data_fh, '<', $test_file_name or die ...;

my @data;
while( <$test_data_fh> ) {
  chomp;
  push @data, split /\t/;
  }</code></pre>

<p>I can execute the tests with <span class="terminal">perl tests.t</span> Now none of the data are in the test file. And, there's nothing special about a simple text file. I could do a little bit more work to take the data from an Excel file (perhaps that most useful wizard skill in the world of business) or even a database:</p>

<pre><code>use DBI;

my $dbh = DBI->connect( ... );
my $sth = $dbh->prepare( 'SELECT * FROM tests' );

$sth->execute();

while( my $row = $sth->fetchrow_arrayref ) {
  state $index = 0;

  is(  $f->sprintf( $row->[0], $row->[1] ), $row->[2],
    $index++ . ": $row->[1] with format $row->[0] returns $row->[2]"
     );

  }</code></pre>

<p>That's the idea. I separate the data and the tests to give myself some flexibility. How I access the data and how I test depend on my particular problems.</p>
