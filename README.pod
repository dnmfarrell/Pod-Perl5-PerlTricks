=head1 NAME

Pod::PerlTricks - parser for PerlTricks pseudopod

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Pod::PerlTricks::Grammar;

  my $match = Pod::PerlTricks::Grammar.parsefile('example.pod');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PerlTricks pseudopod extends ordinary L<pod|http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html> with new syntax for blogging / publishing. C<Pod::PerlTricks::Grammar> supports all of regular pod, plus the following new directives.

=head2 new command blocks

=head3 include filepath

The C<=include> directive takes a filepath to another pod file. When C<Pod::PerlTricks::Grammar> parses the include directive, it automatically reads and includes the pod in the other file into the match object.

This is useful if you have boilerplate text you want ot include in evry pod file, (like author details) but don't want to type out every time.

  =include path/to/author.pod

=head3 =author-name, author-bio, author-image

The C<=author-*> command directives are to represent author details.

  =author-name Jane Smith

  =author-bio Jane Smith is a professional programmer with 12 years of experience, specializing in acme code ...

  =author-image path/to/j_smith.jpg

=head3 tags

C<=tags> accepts a horizontal whitespace-separated list of tags to be used as metadata

  =tags programming perl io

=head3 image, cover-image

Both C<=image> and C<=cover-image> are intended to include images, the only difference between them is C<=cover-image> is supposed to denote the primary image for the article, whereas C<=image> represents an image inline in the article.

  =image L<Image caption|/path/to/image.png>

  =cover-image L</path/to/image.png>

=head3 table

C<=table> indicates the start of a pipe-separated table. The directive must be followed by a blank line, and then the table itself. The first row is the header row. The table is terminted by a blank line.

  =table

  | Team           | Score |
  | The Farmers    | 54    |
  | Timeout United | 21    |

The whitespace around the pipes is optional and will not be associated with the text in the cell.

=head3 chapter, title, subtitle, =ection

These are article metadata directives, e.g.:

  =title 5 Ways to Optimize Your Code

=head3 publish-date

C<=publish-date> takes an ISO8601 datetime, with an optional timezone component. This can be used to determine when an article "goes live" on a blog site, and is also just useful metadata.

  =publish-date 2015-09-30T18:00:00

=head2 New formatting codes

=head3 DE<lt>dataE<gt>, TE<lt>terminalE<gt>

D stands for data, and T for terminal to complement the CE<lt>E<gt> formatting code. These should be styled accordingly (monospaced font, possibly colored background).

=head3 GE<lt>github/repoE<gt>

G stands for GitHub. It should build a hyperlink to a Github repo.

=head3 #E<lt>hashtagE<gt>, @E<lt>handleE<gt>

# is for hashtag. This should build a hashtag search to Twitter. @ is for Twitter handle, and should link to a particular user's Twitter feed.

=head3 NE<lt>noteE<gt>

N is for footnote or notation. The text inside the angle brackets should be formatted as a footnote in the article, with a link to the footnote created inplace of the formatting code.

=head3 WE<lt>wikipedia entryE<gt>

W is for Wikipedia. The text should be replaced with a link to Wikipedia search for the content.
